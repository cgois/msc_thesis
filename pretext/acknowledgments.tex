To my mother, who promised to keep the TV volume low while I was writing. (She did not keep the promise.)

To my favorite sister.

To my other sister, who may be a dog.

To my friends and housemates, who suffered from my awful jokes through so many years.

To Gabrielle, who made every day happier.

To Rabelo, who put a bet on me as a student and inspired me to try my best (I hope the bet paid off.)

To Terra, who showed me science is far more than researching.

To current and past members of the Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory group, with whom work became fun.

To the librarians, cleaning staff and administrative workers, without whom nor this or any work would be possible.

To the Fund for Support to Teaching, Research and Outreach Activities/UNICAMP, for financing this project through the grant no. 3044/19.

And to Rabelo and Gabriela, for thoroughly reviewing this manuscript. All remaining mistakes are their fault.
