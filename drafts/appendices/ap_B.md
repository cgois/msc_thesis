## Weyl operators
- Contextualize (teleportation), define and basic properties (unitary, orthogonal; cite Watrous)
- Explain its action: displacement and local phase
- Show that it generates all ME states when acting in a MES, and that there are $d^2$ ME states in any dimension
	- Steps (is it true?)
		- They are a basis of the Hilbert space
		- They are orthonormal
		- ?Thus they take a vector into orthogonal vectors
		- There are $d^2$ Weyl matrices
		- ?Thus there can only be $d^2$ MES (why? unitaries?)
- Define the discrete Weyl measurement and show it is a measurement
- Discuss the generalization to $K \neq d$
	- Talk here about the measurement used in thm. 1?
