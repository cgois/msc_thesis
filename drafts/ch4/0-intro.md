A key objective in the study of quantum correlations is understanding what makes some behaviors be surely quantum, while others may be not. Progress on this issue improves our understanding of what is "quantum" in quantum theory, which in turn will lead to improved or even innovative technological applications.

In this chapter, I introduce novel methods for deciding whether some set of quantum preparations or quantum measurements "behaves classically". These will, in turn, provide new insights about a nonclassicality activation phenomenon and the relation between measurement incompatibility and quantum behaviors in prepare-and-measure scenarios.

To avoid cluttering the presentation, all methods discussed in this chapter are cast as theorems with detailed proofs in appendix \ref{appendix-a}.
