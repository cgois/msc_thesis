The prepare-and-measure (PM) scenario is one of the simplest and most fundamental examples of correlation scenarios. In it, a preparation apparatus produces and then sends a physical system, over a communication channel, to a measurement device which reads out information from the received state. Wherefore, it is an adequate setting in which to investigate two of the most fundamental building blocks of physical theories, which are states and measurements.

A second key different is that PM scenarios are the simplest settings that presume *communication*, and, as such, should become an indispensable ingredient in quantum networks \cite{}. As with other correlation scenarios, quantum behaviors in the PM scenario can be exploited to build informational protocols that show advantage over their classical counterparts \cite{}. On a more fundamental aspect, they are at the core of proposed informational principles to quantum theory \cite{}, and of quantum ontologies \cite{}.

Differently from the more widely studied Bell nonlocality and EPR steering scenarios, preparations and measurements may behave nonclassically even in the absence of entanglement. Quantum behaviors in PM scenarios must then rely on other strictly quantum features, such as measurement incompatibility and non-orthogonality of states, but the exact relations are still unknown \cite{}.

By allowing for quantum communication, the PM scenario becomes one of the most straightforward settings in which we can investigate these quantum structures. On the other hand, investigating a system's behavior when it is restricted to communicate only classically can help us in understanding how well quantum systems can outperform classical ones. A second resource that also leads to drastically different behaviors is whether the preparation and measurement devices are independent or not. There are, in general, three possible cases; namely, full independence, shared randomness and entanglement assistance. Together with either classical or quantum communication, this will lead to six inequivalent PM scenarios. 

In chapters \ref{chap:pam-classical} and \ref{chap:pam-quantum}, novel results regarding some of these settings will be presented. To build towards that end, we now discuss these many different instances of preparation and measurement devices, and show how this scenario can be seen as a physical implementation of two paramountly important communication protocols.

> In many communication-related tasks quantum protocols are superior to classical ones. In cryptography, secret sharing, and communication complexity two particular approaches to “quantization” of classical tasks are used. The parties use quantum communication instead of classical communication, or the communication stays classical but the parties are allowed to share some entanglement. Examples for both approaches include [1] and [2] in cryptography, [3] and [4] in secret sharing, and [5] and [6] in communication complexity.
