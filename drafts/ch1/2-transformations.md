# Transformations

- We now know how to describe static physical systems, which is something that physical systems rarely are. In quantum theory, the evolution of a closed system is governed by the Schrödinger equation. Its solution dictates that an initial state $\rho$ that transforms to $\rho^\prime$ does so unitarily following $\rho^\prime = U \rho U^\dagger$. Here, $U$ must be an unitary operator, which means that $UU^\dagger = U^\dagger U = \id$. Given $U$, we can always find a Hamiltonian $H$ and a suitable interaction time to perform the evolution. Nonetheless, these are not the most general transformations that a quantum state can undergo.

- Taking the operational approach, we will define the most general transformation as any one that takes a density operator into another. [...]
